#   Emotions In Pandemic 
People make the pandemic seems like a dream come true. But it was really a nightmare for me atleast. Before, I begin this story, one thing you should know is that I am not even a extroverted person, so this should've been heaven to me. But it was not.   
# Alone

I remember asking my mom if I can go walk around the block, just to feel human and free. I've been inside the house for 4 months now. I was starting to feel that I was living the same day over and over and over again. I was going mad, day by day I was losing my sanity. My mom finally made me go outside to the park. I felt like the only person on planet earth. Do I need human interaction? Why do I feel so empty? Sad world.
